TODO:
- setup a proper traning loop with a dataset of input-label pairs
  - enable as much logging as possible!
  - across different train/eval steps, handle:
    - internal state of loggers across train and eval steps
    - state of neurons
    - state of external fields in the ensemble
  - monitor:
    - couplings histogram
    - relative size of field types
    - accuracy on train set
    - length of relaxation in each step
    - (with few samples) similarity between fixed points obtained with same input-label pair
- are we able to learn more than one pattern?
- perceptron rule?
    - monitor 'symmetricity' of coupling matrix (e.g. typical abs(J_ij - J_ji) vs typical abs(J_ij) )
- structural changes:
  - ferromagnetic component instead of self coupling
  - 0-1 states and sparsity
