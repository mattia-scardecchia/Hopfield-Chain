TODO:
- learn a single pattern-label pair with hebb. Is the label retrieved by conditioning on
  the input and letting the label evolve? If not, can we tweak inference to make it happen?
- are we able to learn more than one pattern?
- perceptron rule?
    - monitor 'symmetricity' of coupling matrix
- structural changes:
  - ferromagnetic component instead of self coupling
  - 0-1 states and sparsity
