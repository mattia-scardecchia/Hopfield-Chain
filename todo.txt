TODO:
- implement replicated system
    - for simplicity, make an independent submodule replicated in src
      to handle the simulation
    - maybe have a way to 'export' replicas as HopfieldNetwork objects
      from single_net. This way, post-convergence analysis can be shared.
    - try to cover both chain interaction and clique interaction between
      replicas with a single implementation! Only difference is in local
      field computation...

LATER:
- simplify implementation of single_net submodule?
  - it's arguably too abstract. e.g. stopping condition object is ridiculous.
  - however, multi_net will likely supersede it --> wasted effort...
