TODO:
- implement replicated system
    - for simplicity, make an independent submodule replicated in src
      to handle the simulation
    - maybe have a way to 'export' replicas as HopfieldNetwork objects
      from single_net. This way, post-convergence analysis can be shared.
    - try to cover both chain interaction and clique interaction between
      replicas with a single implementation! Only difference is in local
      field computation...

LATER:
- refactor single_net submodule. Code should organized as follows:
    - hopfield submodule: HopfieldNetwork object to hold a single single net.
      Functionality to analyze a configuration (e.g. stability)
    - single_net submodule: let a single net evolve
    - replicated submodule: let a replicated system of nets evolve
